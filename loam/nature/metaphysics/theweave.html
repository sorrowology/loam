		<h1>The Weave</h1>
		<p>The Weave is the name given to the repeating cycle that governs the rise and fall of civilizations, gods, and the very shape of the world in Loam Morath. Each cycle is known as a Weave, a span of ages in which fate spins the world through a series of inevitable phases. Though each Weave bears its own Light—a god who rises to push back the Mists—the outcome is always the same: the Light must fall, and the world is swallowed once more.</p>

		<p>Many believe the Weave is a design of the gods, or perhaps a prison for them. Others say the Weave is not divine at all, but simply the shape that destiny takes when left unchecked.</p>
		<br>

		<h1>The Phases of the Weave</h1>
		<h2>The Swallowing</h2>
		
		<p>The world is reclaimed by the natural force of the Mists, which creep over the land, consuming empires, breaking borders, and drowning the light of civilization. It is a time of despair, where monsters roam and the old gods fall silent.</p>

		<h2>The Kindling</h2>
		<p>From the ruin, a new Light is born—someone or something that embodies hope, defiance, or divine power. The Kindling marks the rise of a central figure who begins to challenge the chaos, gathering followers, power, or vision.</p>
	
		<h2>The Fracturing</h2>
		<p>With the threat of the Mists pushed back, the world fractures. Nations splinter, peoples war, and mortals turn on each other. The Light is often tested here—not by monsters, but by mankind. This is the age of infighting, when unity collapses under fear and pride.</p>

		<h2>The Reckoning</h2>
		<p>From the depths of the Mists, ancient harbingers rise—primordial forces and creatures seeking to reclaim the world entirely. As mortals falter, the Light must confront this greater threat, often at tremendous cost.</p>

		<h2>The Silencing</h2>
		<p>In the final phase, the Light sacrifices themselves to halt the harbingers. The world is not saved, merely delayed. The Mists reclaim the land once more, and a new Weave begins. The cycle resets—changed, but never broken.</p>
		<br>

		<h1>Burning the Weave</h1>
		<p>Though the Weaves have turned for untold ages, many believe they are not eternal. Myths speak of a Weave in which the Light is not a god, but a mortal—one unbound by fate. If the Light can endure the Reckoning without falling, perhaps the Silencing can be denied. Until then, the world remains bound to the Weave, its threads drawn ever forward by destiny's loom.</p>
