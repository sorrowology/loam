	<h1>1. The Weave of the Mistborn</h1>
	<div class="quotebox">
		<p>“The stars bled, and those who dwell beyond the Veil came forth.”</p>
		-- A faunthar hymn from an unknown time
	</div>
	<p>The First Weave marks the arrival of the <a>veilkin</a> and the <a>shadespawn</a>, two elemental peoples born of other realms: the <a>Dreaming Veil</a> and the <a>Shadehollow</a>. Their empires—beautiful and terrible—rose swiftly, then tore each other apart as the cycle turned.</p>
	
	<p>The Light of this Weave was <a>Kazhor, Bringer of Ruin</a>, a force of retribution who struck down both realms to halt the primordials.</p>

	<h1>2. The Weave of the Tyrants</h1>
	<div class="quotebox">
		<p>“Scales ruled, and tides reigned—but the beasts they forged turned against them..”</p>
		-- A faunthar hymn from an unknown time
	</div>
	<p>In the Second Weave, the <a>drakoni</a> and <a>abyssalan</a> were brought into existence—dragon-blooded lords of land and fire, and deep-dwelling mystics of the ocean depths. Their empires stretched across desert and sea, ruthless and magnificent.</p>

	<p><a>Drakonis, the Wyrm-Sovereign</a>, was this Weave’s Light. His sacrifice held back the primordials.</p>

	<h1>3. The Weave of Mourning</h1>
	<div class="quotebox">
		<p>“Love made man, and sorrow shaped his throne.”</p>
		-- A faunthar hymn from an unknown time
	</div>
	<p>The Third Weave saw the creation of <a>humanity</a> by <a>Khaedros, the God-King</a>, who forged mortals from grief after the death of his beloved, <a>Thymera, the Mother of the Wilds</a>. Humanity rose quickly, building city-states and fragile kingdoms across Loam Morath.</p>

	<p>The Light of this Weave was Khaedros himself, who gave his life to save the world, believing his children might one day break the cycle he could not.</p>

	<h1>4. The Weave of Ashes</h1>
	<div class="quotebox">
		<p>“No crown. No altar. No fate. A man walks alone.”</p>
		-- A faunthar hymn from an unknown time
	</div>
	<p>The current age, the Fourth Weave, is still unfolding. It is an age of shattered kingdoms, broken gods, and quiet resistance. The Mists rise again. But for the first time, the Light is not a god—it is a man.</p>
